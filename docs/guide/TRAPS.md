# Traps — bugs this codebase has actually had

Every one of these cost real time. None are obvious. Check your change
against this list before opening a PR; **add new traps as you hit them.**

## three.js r128

- **Instanced bounding spheres.** r128 sizes an `InstancedMesh` bounding
  sphere from the base geometry — 1,400 seats look like one seat at the
  origin and get culled. Widening the sphere fixes culling **and breaks
  per-instance raycasts** (same sphere per instance). Rule: things you
  must stand on keep an honest local sphere + `frustumCulled = false`;
  decorative batches get the wide sphere + `raycast = ()=>{}`.
- **`visible` is only a drawing flag.** Raycasts sail through and hit
  the geometry anyway. Scenery that is "off" also needs
  `layers.disableAll()`.
- **`camera.position` stops being world** once `VR.rig.add(camera)` —
  use `getWorldPosition` for anything comparing against the camera.
- **Orientation signs** (bitten four separate times): `rotateX(-π/2)`
  maps shape-y to world −z; `rotateY(π/2)` mirrors; a box's long axis is
  local Y. Draw a probe before trusting your mental picture.

## The stage swap

- **DOM cached on a per-stage object.** Each lineset once cached its
  table row in `ls.ui`; rebuilding the table for another stage detached
  the rows and the old stage kept updating a table nobody could see.
  Rebuild-and-requery, never cache DOM across swaps.
- **Timers and holds crossing the swap**: cue-follow timeouts, running
  scripts, held VR ropes, audio loops — all have driven the WRONG
  stage's rig after a walk. Anything live must be parked, cancelled, or
  re-based on `stageSwitch`.
- `vrClearRopes` opens only ROPE holds on purpose — a carried body or
  cart survives the stage walk.

## JavaScript / concatenated-file effects

- **`typeof` does not protect a `const` declared later in the same
  script** — it throws. Function declarations hoist across the WHOLE
  concatenated file, so early code can reach late globals. `VR` is a
  `var` for this reason.
- **Duplicate function names**: two `function damaskTex()` existed once;
  hoisting means the later part's silently wins everywhere. Grep before
  naming.
- **Never hand a shared temp to a function that writes it** (the
  aliasing trap, bitten twice): `snapQuantize`'s first line overwrites
  its argument — passing the shared `_aq2` made every "lie flat" offer
  stand pieces bolt upright. `vrTapeLine` grew its own temps for the
  same reason. If a helper writes to a vector/quat argument, callers
  must not pass a shared scratch object.
- **A flag used for two purposes will eventually mean the wrong one.**
  `userData.moves` meant both "don't freeze" and "crew keep off" — the
  jungle-gym bars were never struck. Split flags.

## VR (p9)

- **vr.js pins some buttons by LITERAL PIXEL** (the fly-page RAISE/LOWER
  rows) — shifting canvas layout silently breaks them. New screens
  should use `vrHit` META so regions are found by meaning, not pixel
  (the goods picker does this; prefer it).
- Held bodies follow the grip KINEMATICALLY — never re-parent to the
  hand. The ONE exception is the paint roller (deliberate; release
  always re-racks it, including from `vrOnEnd` BEFORE the hold drops).
- Grab arbitration is nearest-wins across classes with per-class radii —
  see VR.md. Adding a grab class means extending the cross-checks.

## Tests / jsdom

- **jsdom's `MouseEvent` has no `movementX`/`movementY`** — not 0,
  undefined. The game guards to 0, so synthetic hauls do nothing and it
  looks like broken game code. Shim the event (`full14.js` has it).
- **A regex literal inside a test PROBE template loses its backslashes**
  (`/\d/` arrives as `/d/`) — build regexes from doubled-backslash
  strings there.
- **Test through the DOM, not the model** — a detached row still fires
  its handler perfectly well. Go through `document.querySelectorAll`.
- **Measure the right thing.** Past tests passed while wrong: a darkness
  probe swept in chandeliers 30m away through a shut door; a floor probe
  found the fly gallery instead of the stage; "is anything below zero"
  says nothing about whether a set sits on the deck (compare the SAME
  production across stages). And a weak test can be masked by a stronger
  neighbouring clamp — test the barest case (the dressed-pipe/`asmH`
  lesson).
- `tests/build.js` boots a SECOND jsdom world to round-trip the save —
  it needs `url:` on JSDOM; `about:blank` has no localStorage.

## Environment

- PowerShell 5.1 mangles `git commit -m` with double quotes — message to
  file, `-F` it.
- Never `git add -A` while agent worktrees exist under `.claude/` —
  gitlink pointers ride into the commit (`.gitignore` covers it now,
  but don't lean on it).
- The Quest Browser caches HARD — bust Pages with `?v=N` (bump N) or
  clear site data before deciding a fix "didn't work".
- `.gitattributes` pins LF because `build.sh` breaks under CRLF.
